JWT - JSON Web Tokens
Form of User identification that is issued after the user's authentication
takes place. When the user completes his login process, and he is
authenticated, REST API will issue the client application and access
token and RT (Refresh Token)

AT(access token) is given a short time before it expires - usually 5-15 minutes
Refresh Token is given longer duration ranging from hour to several days

For front-end access tokens should be stored in memory *1, so they will
be automatically lost when the app is closed. They should not be stored in
local storage or cookie (You can do it, but ask the client whether he can
trust the device).

*1 - application state

API will issue refresh token in httpOnly cookie (Not accessible with Js)
They must have expiration.

RefreshToken should not have ability to issue new refresh tokens
 -> indefinite access in wrong hands(hackers hand)

 SUMMARY:
 AT process involves issuing an AT during user authorisation(login).
 User's application can then access REST API's protected routes
 with the AT until it expires. API will verify the AT with
 middleware everytime the AT is used to make req(REQUEST).
 When the AT does expire, the user's app will need to send RT
 to API's refresh endpoint to get new AT.

 RT is also issued during user auth. REST API refresh endpoint will
  verify the token and cross-reference the RT in database too.

Storing reference to RT in database will allow refresh tokens to be
 terminated earlier, if the user decides to log out. ** That's why
 RT need to be allowed to expire.

JWT
- confirm authentication
-Allow access to API endpoints
- Endpoints provide data resource
- Use Authorisation header


 ///////////////////////////////// FrontEnd AUTH
 const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/auth/login', {
 method: "POST",
 credentials: 'include',
 headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
 body: JSON.stringify({login,password})
 }


 REFRESH TOKEN ROTATION
 When new access is issued, a new refresh token is also issued.
 Reuse Detection will allow RT to be used only once. It will be invalidated after use.
 If RT is attempted, all RT will be deleted, which requires user to log in again.
